            <h2>Student</h2>
            <p>Present</p>
            <p>
                I am currently enrolled at Lambda School. I started my coding journey back in January of 2019. I went to a couple of tech events and got in contact with the good folks of CareerKarma and decided to apply for Lambda. This has been one of the most immersive courses I have taken in my life and for good reason. Due to personal resaons I had taken time off from being a student to handle personal issues and figure out the direction of my life. AFter reflecting and trying other things I have found that this has been some of the most rewarding work. I love that it's a field where you're constantly learning because I am a person who gets bored easily. Love how far I've come in my coding journey but know there's still a lot I need to learn and am looking forward to doing so!

            <p>August 2016 to Present</p>
            <p>
                I am a volunteer coach that works with the linebackers. I help with game planning for the defense. Help conduct workouts
                in our offseason training program. I have conducted one on one and group workouts as well in the offseason. Scout the
                opposing teams offense, looking for keys and indicators that can give us an idea of what to expect in game. At times I
                am a person the kids can just talk to about life outside of the game.

            <p>December 2019 to March 2021</p>
            <p>
                I put together workouts for young men on the team I coach, shared my knowledge and experience from my playing days. it
                helped me improve my teaching ability by getting them understand concepts that weren't familiar to them. Every kid I
                trained ended up starting for us and led us to an undefeated season in 2021(covid restricted season).

            <p>April 2020 to April 2021</p>
            <p>
                Alpha Zeta Logistixs is a third party company that would make deliveries for Amazon. When I started there they were a
                new company. It was a good learning experience for me going from working in an Amazon sort center to delivering packages
                for there. It helped me understand logistics more and why Amazon is the company it is. My organizational skills allowed
                me to get the job done more efficiently. This led to larger pick up loads and more time on the road.

            <p>October 2019 to January 2020</p>
            <p>
                Working here helped me see what warehouse life is like and what an Amazon sort center looks like during peak season. It's not for the faint of heart. Having down pact procedures helped us get the job done efficiently. I worked the floor as a scanner and the work can be back breaking because I was turned to for the larger packages. I was also able to work as a sorter. It consisted of sorting packeages that came down the a chute slide that were sent to the scanning lanes. This is where I excelled at because I was fast worker.

            <h2>Professional Athlete</h2>
            <p>April 2012 to August 2018</p>
            <p>
                I was drafted to the Miami Dolphins in April of 2012. I was known for work ethic but was a bit of a knucklehead. I participated in many community outrech events where I got to see more of what Miami had to offer. After my rookie year I was chosen by our head coach as player he most looked forward to see come back. A testament to my hard work and preparation. I spent two seasons in Miami. After my stint in Miami I wound up in Minnesota. I played linebacker and defensive end there. Usually played the role of the opposing teams best rush defender during that week of practice. Helped out in the community when the opportunity presented itself. I learned different approaches
                to coaching and teaching. After there I waited to get signed during 2016 but nothing came so I had to the opportunity to go back and finish my degree in 2017. After completing my degree an opportunity to play in the CFL for the BC Lions presented itself and I took it. I played defensive end and helped offense prepare for game day. Provided the looks they would be see from that weeks opponent. At this point my heart wasn't really in it and it showed. My time ended there in August of 2018.
