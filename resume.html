            <h2>Delivery Driver at Alpha Zeta Logistixs</h2>
            <p>2020 to 2021</p>
            <p>
                Alpha Zeta Logistixs is a third party company that makes deliveries for Amazon. When I started there they were a
                new company. It was a good learning experience for me. Going from working in an Amazon sort center to delivering packages
                for them. It helped me understand the logistics of the delivery industry and why Amazon is the company it is. My organizational skills allowed me to get the job done efficiently. This led to larger pick up loads and less time on the road.

            <h2>Warehouse Associate</h2>
            <p>2019 to 2020</p>
            <p>
                Working here helped me see what warehouse life is like and what an Amazon sort center looks like during peak season. It's not for the faint of heart. I worked the floor as a inventory specialist scanning and sorting packages. I was also able to work as a sorter. It consisted of sorting packeages that came down a chute slide that has four lanes and I directed them to the appropiate lane. This is where I excelled because I worked efficiently and rarely made mistakes.

            <p>
                I was drafted to the Miami Dolphins in April of 2012. I was known for my work ethic. I participated in many community outrech events where I got to see more of what Miami has to offer. After my rookie year I was chosen by our head coach as player he most looked forward to see come back. A testament to my hard work and preparation. I spent two seasons in Miami. After my stint in Miami I wound up in Minnesota. I usually played the role of the opposing teams best pass rusher during preparation. I helped out in the community when the opportunity presented itself. I learned different approaches to coaching and teaching. After there I waited to get signed during 2016 but didn't. I had the opportunity to go back and finish my degree in 2017. After completing my degree an opportunity to play in the CFL for the BC Lions presented itself and I took it. I played defensive end and was placed on practice squad. At this point my heart wasn't really in it and it showed. My time ended there in August of 2018.

            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>June 2008 to June 2012</p>
            <p>
                I participated in O Heroes, a leadership program for athletes. I volunteered at the local Boys and Girls club and was
                involved in recruitment as a freshman and sophomore. I hosted many recruits and was in consistent communication with the
                recruiting coordinator which led to landing our fair share of quality players. I was voted team captain by my teammates my senior year and was a 1st team All Pac12 linebacker. We won one Pac10 championship, two Pac12 championships and a Rose bowl while I was there. We made it to the Holiday Bowl, two Rose Bowls and a National Championship.
