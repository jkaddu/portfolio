            <p>Present</p>
            <p>
                I am currently enrolled at Lambda School. I started my coding journey back in January of 2019. I went to a couple of tech events and got in contact with the good people of CareerKarma and decided to apply for Lambda. This has been one of the most immersive courses I have taken and for good reason. Due to personal resaons I had taken time off from being a student to handle personal issues and figure out the direction of my life. AFter reflecting and trying other things I decided to start again. I love that it's a field where you're constantly learning because I am a person who gets bored easily. I've come a long way in my coding journey and know there's still a lot I need to learn. I'm looking forward to doing so!

            <h2>Coach</h2>
            <p>August 2016 to Present</p>
            <p>
                I am a volunteer coach that works with linebackers at Vacaville High School. I help with game planning for the defense, scouting the opposing teams offense, looking for keys and tendencies that can give us an idea of what to expect come game time. I help conduct workouts in our offseason, one on one and group workouts.

            <p>December 2019 to March 2021</p>
            <p>
                I put together workouts, shared my knowledge and experience from my playing days. Training
                helped me improve my teaching ability by getting them understand concepts they weren't familiar with. Every kid I
                trained ended up starting for the team I coached on and led us to an undefeated season in 2021(covid restricted season).

            <h2>Delivery Driver</h2>
            <p>April 2020 to April 2021</p>
            <p>
                Alpha Zeta Logistixs is a third party company that would make deliveries for Amazon. When I started there they were a
                new company. It was a good learning experience for me going from working in an Amazon sort center to delivering packages
                for there. It helped me understand the logistics of the delivery industry and why Amazon is the company it is. My organizational skills allowed me to get the job done efficiently. This led to larger pick up loads and less time on the road.

            <h2>Warehouse Associate</h2>
            <p>October 2019 to January 2020</p>
            <p>
                Working here helped me see what warehouse life is like and what an Amazon sort center looks like during peak season. It's not for the faint of heart. Having down pact procedures helped us get the job done efficiently. I worked the floor as a scanner and the work can be back breaking. I was also able to work as a sorter. It consisted of sorting packeages that came down a chute slide that has four lanes and I directed them to the appropiate lane. This is where I excelled because I worked fast and rarely made mistakes.

            <h2>Professional Athlete</h2>
            <p>April 2012 to August 2018</p>
            <p>
                I was drafted to the Miami Dolphins in April of 2012. I was known for work ethic but was a bit of a knucklehead. I participated in many community outrech events where I got to see more of what Miami had to offer. After my rookie year I was chosen by our head coach as player he most looked forward to see come back. A testament to my hard work and preparation. I spent two seasons in Miami. After my stint in Miami I wound up in Minnesota. I played linebacker and defensive end. Usually played the role of the opposing teams best pass rusher during preparation. I helped out in the community when the opportunity presented itself. I learned different approaches to coaching and teaching. After there I waited to get signed during 2016 but didn't. I had the opportunity to go back and finish my degree in 2017 so I did. After completing my degree an opportunity to play in the CFL for the BC Lions presented itself and I took it. I played defensive end and was placed on practice squad. At this point my heart wasn't really in it and it showed. My time ended there in August of 2018.

            <p>June 2008 to June 2012</p>
            <p>
                I participated in O Heroes, a leadership program for athletes. I volunteered at the local Boys and Girls club and was
                involved in recruitment as a freshman and sophomore. I hosted many recruits and was in consistent communication with the
                recruiting coordinator which led to landing our fair share of quality players. I was voted team captain by my teammates my senior year and was a 1st team All Pac12 linebacker. We won one Pac10 championship, two Pac12 championships and a Rose bowl while I was there. We made one Holiday Bowl appearance, two Rose Bowl appearances and a National Championship appearance.
